# Logistic_Regression

a model that yields a binary dependent variable. Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1".



### Let's build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats :)


we will use gradient descent as an optimization algorithm

1. First, we process the images. Get them ready to feed into the model

2. Second, We use logistic regression in a neural network 


Functions we have to process:
1. Sigmoid
2. Initialize matrix(weight and bias)
